# Energy-Efficient Navigation Optimization of Maritime Transport

This project explores the optimization of maritime shipping routes in the Indian Subcontinent using real-time oceanographic data. The goal is to reduce navigation costs while avoiding hazardous marine conditions by applying and comparing multiple routing algorithms.

## 🚢 Project Overview

We use data from the **Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)** to model oceanic conditions and calculate cost-effective ship routes. A bounding box is defined over the region of interest, and key variables are converted into a cost matrix that feeds routing algorithms.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** – Finds the shortest path in graphs with non-negative weights.
- **A* Search Algorithm** – Uses heuristics for faster and more informed pathfinding.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** – Handles negative weights and computes shortest paths from a single source.

Each algorithm is evaluated for performance, accuracy, and suitability in dynamic maritime environments.
